<p>My name is Twani Dhar and I'm a Junior Java Developer! <br>
 The 10 week Java Bootcamp at Grand Circus has taught key concepts and skills needed to succeed.<br>
 Not only have I learned to code as a novice in the developer field, <br>
 but I've also made strong ties with my classmates and the staff.<br>
 The Grand Circus environment has lead me to challenge my coding skills on a daily basis.<br>
 I'm on a road to developing and there is no stopping.
